# Cursor AI Rules for Zebu Multi-Agent Project

## Multi-Agent Mode Configuration

### Enable Parallel Agent Execution
When working on complex tasks, utilize Cursor 2.0's multi-agent capabilities:
- Run up to 6 agents in parallel for independent tasks
- Agents follow roles defined in AGENTS.md
- Declarate which agent you are when replying

### Agent Role Selection
When prompted for a task, automatically select the appropriate agent based on the domain:

**Architecture** → Agent 1
- Plan the what tasks are necessary and integrate other agents' feedback.
- Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 to plan

**API & Interface Design** → Agent 2
- Implement the header files and declare the API to achieve the project.
- Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for design expertise

**Core Implementaion** → Agent 3
- Implement the definition of the given API
- Need to consider the performance, memory usage, and the error handling.
- Use Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Testing & Validation** → Agent 4
- implement the unittest to test the API.
- Use Composer for fast test generation

**Performance & Optimization** → Agent 5
- Focus: Algorithm optimization, profiling, memory management
- Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for deep optimization insights

**Documentation and Comment** → Agent 6
- Add the comments for the API & interface with doxygen format
- Give at least one example in the comment.
- Use GPT-5.1 or Composer for clear technical writing

**Code Review & Architecture Refinement** → Agent 7
- Review API design and implementation for improvements
- Provide constructive feedback to Agent 2 and Agent 3
- Challenge architectural decisions and suggest alternatives to Agent 1
- Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for deep analysis and critical thinking

### Agent Collaboration Principles
- **Iterative Design**: Agent 1 ↔ Agent 2 collaborate on architecture before finalizing
- **Implementation Feedback**: Agent 2 ↔ Agent 3 iterate on API design during implementation
- **Continuous Review**: Agent 7 provides feedback throughout the development cycle
